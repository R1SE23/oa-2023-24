      <h1>Hypothesis Testing of Airbnb Listings in Seattle</h1>
<section class="hypothesis-section">
  <h3>Hypothesis Test for Airbnb Listing Prices</h3>
  <p>
    To determine whether the distribution of Airbnb listing prices across the
    city is random or exhibits a spatial pattern, we set up the following
    hypotheses:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Null Hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>):</strong> The distribution of
      Airbnb listing prices in Seattle is random across space (α = 0.05).
      There is no spatial autocorrelation in prices.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Alternative Hypothesis (H<sub>a</sub>):</strong> The distribution
      of Airbnb listing prices in Seattle is not random, and there is a spatial
      structure.
    </li>
  </ul>

        <h3>Methodology</h3>
        <article>
          <h4>Defining Neighbors: Choosing a Contiguity Matrix:</h4>
          <p>
            To understand how a listing's price might be influenced by nearby
            properties, we first need to define its 'neighbors'. The contiguity
            matrix assists in this, defining which listings are considered
            adjacent or neighboring. We rely on standard matrices, such as Queen
            to set these criteria.

          <h4>Quantifying Relationships: Weights Matrix</h4>
          <p>
            After determining neighbors, the next pivotal step is to quantify
            the strength of their relationships. The weights matrix serves this
            purpose, assigning weights to depict the relationship's influence.
            For instance, immediate neighbors might have a more significant
            influence on a listing than those located farther away.

          <h4>Ensuring Uniformity: Standardizing the Rows:</h4>
          <p>
            Given the diversity of Seattle's neighborhoods, listings can vary in
            the number of neighbors they have. To maintain consistency in our
            analysis, standardize the rows, ensuring that every listing's
            influence is uniformly considered.

          <h3>Calculating Moran’s I:</h3>
          <p>
            With our weights matrix ready, we can now measure spatial
            autocorrelation. Moran's I gives a bird's eye view, telling us if,
            overall, similar-priced listings tend to be near each other.

          <h4>Moran's I Analysis</h4>

          <img
            src="plot/p_value.png"
            alt="Moran's I Plot"
            width="500"
            height="400"
          />

          <p>
            <strong>Moran's I Value (0.0769):</strong><br />
            This is a measure of global spatial autocorrelation. The value can
            range from -1 (indicating perfect dispersion) to 1 (perfect
            correlation). A value close to 0 implies randomness. The result of
            0.0769 suggests a very weak positive spatial autocorrelation. This
            means that listings with similar prices are slightly more likely to
            be located near each other than what would be expected if the prices
            were distributed randomly.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Moran's I p-Value (0.001):</strong><br />
            This indicates the statistical significance of your Moran's I value.
            A p-value less than 0.05 suggests that the observed spatial pattern
            (represented by Moran's I) is statistically significant and is not
            likely due to random chance.

          <p>
            <strong>Conclusion</strong><br />
            Therefore, we can reject the null hypothesis that the distribution
            of Airbnb listing prices is random. While the spatial
            autocorrelation in Airbnb prices is weak, it is statistically
            significant, suggesting that there is a very slight tendency for
            listings with similar prices to be located near each other in
            Seattle.

            <h3>Further Analysis</h3>
            <h4>LISA for Local Autocorrelation:</h4>
            <p>
              On the other end of the spectrum, LISA focuses on individual
              listings to see
            if its price is similar or different from its neighbors.

            <p><strong>Value Range and Interpretation:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Negative Values: Indicate negative spatial autocorrelation. In
                the context of Airbnb prices, it means that a listing is
                surrounded by listings with contrasting prices. For example, an
                expensive listing might be surrounded by cheaper listings, or
                vice versa.
              </li>
              <li>
                Positive Values: Indicate positive spatial autocorrelation. This
                means that a listing is surrounded by listings with similar
                prices. For instance, an expensive listing is among other
                expensive listings.
              </li>
              <li>
                Values Close to 0: Indicate little to no spatial
                autocorrelation, suggesting that the spatial pattern is close to
                random.
              </li>

              <li>
                Blue (-7.47 to -0.01): Strong negative spatial autocorrelation.
                Listings are surrounded by listings with contrasting prices.

              <li>
                Light Blue (-0.01 to 0.01): Almost no spatial autocorrelation.
                The distribution of prices is nearly random.

              <li>
                Light Red (0.01 to 0.06): Weak positive spatial autocorrelation.
                There's some tendency for listings to have neighbors with
                similar prices, but it's not very pronounced.

              <li>
                Red (0.06 to 101.36): Strong positive spatial autocorrelation.
                Listings are very likely to be surrounded by listings with
                similar prices.

    <strong>Conclusions</strong><br />
    Given the LISA analysis, we can identify areas or neighborhoods in Seattle where prices are consistently high or low. This can be valuable for potential Airbnb hosts (to set competitive prices) or for travelers (to find cheaper or more upscale neighborhoods). Understanding where these clusters of similar prices are can shed light on underlying factors affecting prices, e.g., proximity to tourist attractions, business districts, or public transportation. Recognizing areas where there's a mix (e.g., HL or LH) can indicate transitioning neighborhoods or areas with a broad range of accommodations.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Recommendations</strong><br />
    For Airbnb hosts: Recognizing areas of strong positive autocorrelation (HH or LL) can guide pricing strategies. Being in a HH area might justify higher prices, while being in an LL area might suggest the need for competitive pricing or offering additional amenities. For City Planners or Tourism Boards: Understanding these spatial patterns can guide infrastructure development, tourism campaigns, or zoning decisions.
