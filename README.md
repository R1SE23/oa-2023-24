# DSSD 2023-2024 Admissions Assessment

## Project Overview

The project revolves around performing data analysis and hypothesis testing on Airbnb listing data for the city of Seattle. The dataset, obtained from Inside Airbnb, provides a rich source of information about Airbnb listings, including their prices, locations, and various other attributes.

## Key Components

### Hypothesis Testing Results

One of the primary components of this project is the hypothesis testing. The analysis is aimed at determining whether the distribution of Airbnb listing prices across the city of Seattle exhibits a spatial pattern or if it's purely random. This involves formulating hypotheses, conducting statistical tests, and interpreting the results.

### Interactive Visualization

To enhance the understanding of the data and the results of the hypothesis testing, interactive visualizations have been created. These visualizations help in presenting complex information in a more comprehensible manner.
